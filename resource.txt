Your shell should:
• Display a prompt when waiting for a new command.
• Have a working history.
• Search and launch the right executable (based on the PATH variable or using a
relative or an absolute path).
• Avoid using more than one global variable to indicate a received signal. Consider
the implications: this approach ensures that your signal handler will not access your
main data structures.
Be careful. This global variable cannot provide any other
information or data access than the number of a received signal.
Therefore, using "norm" type structures in the global scope is
forbidden.

• Not interpret unclosed quotes or special characters which are not required by the
subject such as \ (backslash) or ; (semicolon).
• Handle ’ (single quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-
characters in the quoted sequence.
• Handle " (double quote) which should prevent the shell from interpreting the meta-
characters in the quoted sequence except for $ (dollar sign).
• Implement redirections:
◦ < should redirect input.
◦ > should redirect output.
◦ << should be given a delimiter, then read the input until a line containing the
delimiter is seen. However, it doesn’t have to update the history!
◦ >> should redirect output in append mode.
• Implement pipes (| character). The output of each command in the pipeline is
connected to the input of the next command via a pipe.
• Handle environment variables ($ followed by a sequence of characters) which
should expand to their values.
• Handle $? which should expand to the exit status of the most recently executed
foreground pipeline.
• Handle ctrl-C, ctrl-D and ctrl-\ which should behave like in bash.
• In interactive mode:
◦ ctrl-C displays a new prompt on a new line.
◦ ctrl-D exits the shell.
◦ ctrl-\ does nothing.
• Your shell must implement the following builtins:
◦ echo with option -n
◦ cd with only a relative or absolute path
◦ pwd with no options
◦ export with no options
◦ unset with no options
◦ env with no options or arguments
◦ exit with no options

The readline() function can cause memory leaks. You don’t have to fix them. But
that doesn’t mean your own code, yes the code you wrote, can have memory
leaks

One of the projects that I am exploring at RC, is writing a UNIX shell. This is the first part of a series of posts that will eventually follow.

Disclaimer: I am not a subject expert on writing shells and I am sharing my findings as I learn more about this myself.
What is a shell?

A lot has been written about this, so I will not go into too much detail about the definition. However, in one line -

    A shell is an interface that allows you to interact with the kernel of an operating system.

How does a shell work?

A shell parses commands entered by the user and executes this. To be able to do this, the workflow of the shell will look like this:

    Startup the shell
    Wait for user input
    Parse user input
    Execute the command and return the result
    Go back to 2.

There is one important piece to all of this though: processes. The shell is the parent process. This is the main thread of our program which is waiting for user input. However, we cannot execute the command in the main thread itself, because of the following reasons:

    An erroneous command will cause the entire shell to stop working. We want to avoid this.
    Independent commands should have their own process blocks. This is known as isolation and falls under fault tolerance.

Fork

To be able to avoid this, we use the system call fork. I thought I understood fork until I wrote about four lines of code using it.

fork creates a copy of the current process. The copy is known as the child and each process in a system has a unique process id (pid) associated to it. Let’s take a look at the following piece of code:

fork.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int
main() {
    pid_t child_pid = fork();
        
    // The child process
    if (child_pid == 0) {
        printf("### Child ###\nCurrent PID: %d and Child PID: %d\n",
               getpid(), child_pid);
    } else {
        printf("### Parent ###\nCurrent PID: %d and Child PID: %d\n",
               getpid(), child_pid);
    }
 
    return 0;
}

The fork system call returns twice, once for each process. This sounds counter intuitive at first. But let’s take a look at what goes underneath the hood.

    By invoking fork we are creating a new branch in our program. This is not the same as a traditional if-else branch. fork creates a copy of the current process and creates a new one out of it. The resulting system call returns the process id of the child process.

    Immediately after the fork call has succeeded, both the child and the parent process (the main thread of our code) are running simultaneously.

To give you a better idea of the program flow, take a look at this diagram:
fork

The fork() creates a new child process, but at the same time, execution of the parent process is not halted. The child process begins and finishes its execution independent of the parent and vice versa.

A quick note before we proceed further, the getpid system call returns the current process id.

If you compile and execute the code, you’d get an output similar to the following:

### Parent ###
Current PID: 85247 and Child PID: 85248
### Child ###
Current PID: 85248 and Child PID: 0

In the block under ### Parent ###, the current process ID is 85247 and that of the child is 85248. Note that the pid of the child is greater than that of the parent, implying that the child was created after the parent. (Update: As someone correctly pointed out on Hacker News this isn’t guaranteed, although the more likely scenario. Reason being that, the OS could recycle older unused process ids.

In the block under ### Child ###, the current process ID is 85248, which is the same as the pid of the child in the previous block. However, the child pid here is 0.

Actual numbers would vary on each execution.

You’d be forgiven for thinking about how can child_pid assume two different values in the same execution flow, when we have clearly assigned a value to child_pid once on line 9. However, recall that invoking fork creates a new process, which is identical to the current one. As a result, in the parent process, child_pid is the actual value of the child process that just got created, and the child process itself has no child of its own, as a result of which the value of child_pid is 0.

Thus, the if-else block we have defined from lines 12 to 16 is required to control what code to execute in the child, vs the parent. When child_pid is 0, the code block will be executed under the child process, while the else block will be executed under the parent process instead. The order in which the blocks will be executed cannot be determined, and depends on the operating system’s scheduler.
Introducing determinism

Let me introduce you to the system call sleep. To quote the linux man pages:

    sleep – suspend execution for an interval of time

The interval is in seconds.

Let us add a sleep(1) call to the parent process, which would be the else block of our code:

sleep_parent.c


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int
main() {
    pid_t child_pid = fork();

    // The child process
    if (child_pid == 0) {
        printf("### Child ###\nCurrent PID: %d and Child PID: %d\n",
               getpid(), child_pid);
    } else {
        sleep(1); // Sleep for one second
        printf("### Parent ###\nCurrent PID: %d and Child PID: %d\n",
               getpid(), child_pid);
    }
 
    return 0;
}

And when you execute this, the output would be similar to:

### Child ###
Current PID: 89743 and Child PID: 0

and after a span of 1 second, you would see

### Parent ###
Current PID: 89742 and Child PID: 89743

And you will see the same behaviour each time you execute the code. This is because we have made a blocking sleep call in the parent process and the OS scheduler in the meantime finds free CPU time for the child process to be executed.

Similarly, if you add the sleep(1) call to the child process instead, i.e. the if block of our code, you will notice that the output of the parent block immediately on the console. But you will also notice that your program has terminated. And the output of the child block being dumped into stdout. It looks like:

$ gcc -lreadline blog/sleep_child.c -o sleep_child && ./sleep_child
### Parent ###
Current PID: 23011 and Child PID: 23012
$ ### Child ###
Current PID: 23012 and Child PID: 0

The source for this is available in sleep_child.c.

This is because the parent process has nothing to do after the printf statement, and is terminated. However, the child process is blocked on the sleep call for one second after which the printf statement is executed.
Determinism done right

However, using sleep to control your process execution flow is not the best approach, because if you make a sleep call for n seconds:

    How do you guarantee that whatever it is that you are waiting for will complete its execution within those n seconds.
    What if whatever it is that you are waiting for finishes much sooner than n seconds? In that case you are idling unnecessarily.

A better approach here would be using the wait system call instead (or one of the variants). We will use the waitpid system call. It takes the following parameters:

    Process ID of the process for which you want your program to wait.
    A variable which will be populated with information on how the process was terminated.
    Options flag, to customize the behaviour of waitpid

wait.c


#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int
main() {
    pid_t child_pid;
    pid_t wait_result;
    int stat_loc;

    child_pid = fork();
        
    // The child process
    if (child_pid == 0) {
        printf("### Child ###\nCurrent PID: %d and Child PID: %d\n",
               getpid(), child_pid);
        sleep(1); // Sleep for one second
    } else {
        wait_result = waitpid(child_pid, &stat_loc, WUNTRACED);
        printf("### Parent ###\nCurrent PID: %d and Child PID: %d\n",
               getpid(), child_pid);
    }
 
    return 0;
}

When you execute this, you will notice that the child block gets printed immediately and waits for a brief moment (we added the sleep after the printf here). The parent process waits for the child to finish execution after which it is free to execute its own commands.

That’s all for part I. All the code examples shown in this blog post are available here. In the next post, we will explore how to take a command as user input and execute it. Stay tuned.









2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222













In Part I we discussed about the fork system call and its caveats. In this post, we shall explore how to execute commands.
Exec

This brings us to the exec family of functions. Namely, it has the following functions:

    execl
    execv
    execle
    execve
    execlp
    execvp

For our needs, we will use execvp whose signature looks like this:

int execvp(const char *file, char *const argv[]);

The vp in the name of the function indicates that, it accepts the name of a file, for which it will search for in the $PATH variable of the system and an array of arguments to be executed.

You may read the man page for exec for more information on the other functions.

Let us take a look at the following code, which executes the command ls -l -h -a:

execvp.c


#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    char *argv[] = {"ls", "-l", "-h", "-a", NULL};
    execvp(argv[0], argv);

    return 0;
}

A few things to note about the execvp function:

    The first argument is the name of the command
    The second argument consists of the name of the command and the arguments passed to the command itself. It must also be terminated by NULL.
    It also swaps out the current process image with that of the command being executed, but more on that later.

If you compile and execute the above, you will see an output similar to the following:

total 32
drwxr-xr-x  5 dhanush  staff   170B Jun 11 11:32 .
drwxr-xr-x  4 dhanush  staff   136B Jun 11 11:30 ..
-rwxr-xr-x  1 dhanush  staff   8.7K Jun 11 11:32 a.out
drwxr-xr-x  3 dhanush  staff   102B Jun 11 11:32 a.out.dSYM
-rw-r--r--  1 dhanush  staff   130B Jun 11 11:32 execvp.c

Which is exactly the same if you manually execute ls -l -h -a in your primary shell.

Now that we can execute commands, we need to construct something useful using the fork system call that we learned about in part I. In effect we will do the following:

    Accept the command as user input.
    Call fork to create a child process.
    Execute the command in the child process while the parent waits for the command to complete.
    Return back to step 1.

Let us take a look at the following function. which takes a string as the input. We use the library function strtok to split the string by the character space and return an array of strings instead. We also terminate the array by NULL.



#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

char **get_input(char *input) {
    char **command = malloc(8 * sizeof(char *));
    char *separator = " ";
    char *parsed;
    int index = 0;

    parsed = strtok(input, separator);
    while (parsed != NULL) {
        command[index] = parsed;
        index++;

        parsed = strtok(NULL, separator);
    }

    command[index] = NULL;
    return command;
}

If the input to the function is the string "ls -l -h -a", then the function will create an array of the form ["ls", "-l", "-h", "-a", NULL] and return the pointer to this array.

Now in our main function, we invoke readline to read an input from the user, and pass it to get_input we just defined above. Once the input has been parsed, we call fork and call execvp in the child process. Before we dive into the code, take a look at the following diagram, to understand the semantics of execvp first:
execvp

When the fork command completes, the child is an exact copy of the parent process. However, when we invoke execvp, it replaces the current program with the program passed to it in the arguments. What this means is that although the current text, data, heap and stack segments of the process are replaced, the process id still remains unchanged, but the program gets overwritten completely. If the invocation is successful, then execvp never returns, and any code in the child after this will not be executed. And here is the main function:



#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

int main() {
    char **command;
    char *input;
    pid_t child_pid;
    int stat_loc;

    while (1) {
        input = readline("unixsh> ");
        command = get_input(input);

        child_pid = fork();
        if (child_pid == 0) {
            /* Never returns if the call is successful */
            execvp(command[0], command);
            printf("This won't be printed if execvp is successul\n");
        } else {
            waitpid(child_pid, &stat_loc, WUNTRACED);
        }

        free(input);
        free(command);
    }

    return 0;
}

The entire code is available in a single file here. If you compile it with gcc -g -lreadline shell.c and execute the binary, you will have a minimal working shell, and you can use it to run system commands like pwd and ls -lha:

unixsh> pwd
/Users/dhanush/github.com/indradhanush.github.io/code/shell-part-2
unixsh> ls -lha
total 28K
drwxr-xr-x 6 root root  204 Jun 11 18:27 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4.0K Jun 11 16:50 ..
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  16K Jun 11 18:27 a.out
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root  102 Jun 11 15:32 a.out.dSYM
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  130 Jun 11 15:38 execvp.c
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root  997 Jun 11 18:25 shell.c
unixsh> 

Note that the fork is only called after the command has been entered by the user, which means that the user prompt accepting input from the user is the parent process.
Error handling

So far we have assumed that all our commands would work perfectly all the time and we are not handling the errors. So we will make a few changes to shell.c:

    fork - If the OS runs out of memory or reaches the maximum number of allowed processes, a child process will not be created and it will return -1. We add the following to our code:

    ...
    while (1) {
        input = readline("unixsh> ");
        command = get_input(input);

        child_pid = fork();
        if (child_pid < 0) {
            perror("Fork failed");
            exit(1);
        }
    ...

    execvp - As explained above, it will never return on a successful invocation. However, if it will return -1 if the execution has failed. Likewise, we modify our call to execvp:

    ...
            if (execvp(command[0], command) < 0) {
                perror(command[0]);
                exit(1);
            }
    ...

Note that, while the exit call after fork terminates the entire program, the exit call after execvp will only terminate the child, since the code belongs to the child process only.

    malloc - It can fail if the OS runs out of memory. We should exit the program in such a scenario:

char **get_input(char *input) {
    char **command = malloc(8 * sizeof(char *));
    if (command == NULL) {
        perror("malloc failed");
        exit(1);
    }
    ...

    Dynamic memory allocation - Currently our command buffer allocates 8 blocks only. If we enter a command which has more than 8 words, our command will not work as expected. This has been done to keep the example easy to understand and has been left as an exercise for the reader.

The code with error handling as shown above is available here.
Builtin commands

If you try to execute the cd command, you will get an error that says:

cd: No such file or directory

Our shell does not recognize the cd command yet. The reason behind this is that it is not a system program like ls or pwd. Let us take a step back and assume for a moment that cd is a system program as well. What do you think the execution flow will be like? You may want to think about it before reading further.

The flow proceeds like this:

    The user sends the input cd /.
    The shell forks the current process and executes the command in the child.
    After a successful invocation, the child exits and the control is returned to the parent process.
    The current working directory of the parent has not changed, since the command was executed in the child. As a result, the cd command although successful, did not produce the result that we desired.

Thus, to support cd we will have to implement it on our own. We also need to ensure that, if the command entered by the user is cd (or belongs to a list of pre-defined built-in commands), we will not fork the process at all. Instead, we will execute our implementation of cd (or any other built-in) and move on to wait for the next user input. For cd, thankfully we have the chdir function call available to us and using it is straightforward. It accepts the path as an argument and returns 0 upon success and -1 upon a failure. We define our function:

int cd(char *path) {
    return chdir(path);
}

And add a check in our main function for it:

    while (1) {
        input = readline("unixsh> ");
        command = get_input(input);

        if (strcmp(command[0], "cd") == 0) {
            if (cd(command[1]) < 0) {
                perror(command[1]);
            }

            /* Skip the fork */
            continue;
        }
    ...

The code with the above changes is available here and if you compile and execute it, you will be able to run the cd command. Here is an example output:

unixsh> pwd
/Users/dhanush/github.com/indradhanush.github.io/code/shell-part-2
unixsh> cd /
unixsh> pwd
/
unixsh> 

And that brings us to the end of part II. All the code examples shown in this blog post are available here. In the next blog post we will explore the topic of signals and implement handling user interrupts (Ctrl-C). Stay tuned.
Acknowledgements

Thanks to Dominic Spadacene for pairing with me on this and to Saul Pwanson for helping me solve the weird memory leaks when nothing seemed to be working.

Update: Saul mentioned that checking for errors with < 0 is conventionally better than == -1, since some APIs might return negative values other than just -1 and < 0 helps protect against those. I’ve updated the post and the code examples accordingly.

Previously, in Part II we discussed about running system commands and implementing our own built-in commands. In Part III, we explore signal handling.
What are signals?

When driving, one looks out for traffic signals, red or green and takes a decision based on it: to stop or to keep driving. But the traffic signals only come up after some intervals at crossroads and is not present continuously along the road.

We can somewhat apply this analogy to signals in the context of computers as well. A signal is a software interrupt that is sent out from an external event to a process. It may be sent to the process by the kernel, by another process or by itself. A very common example is SIGINT, which is the signal that is sent out when you hit Ctrl-C to exit a program. Before going any further, let us take a look at the following diagram:
signals

The process executes three instructions and terminatess. However, after the second instruction, it receives a signal. At this point the regular execution of the program is interrupted and is passed on to the signal handler. The signal handler is a pre-defined function which is invoked when the signal is received. It returns the process to its normal execution flow, where it goes on to execute the third instruction and exits. However, depending on the code in the signal handler itself, instruction 3 might not be executed at all. For eg: If the signal being sent is SIGINT (Ctrl-C), the program exits. Also, it is not guaranteed that a signal interrupt will only occur when a program is between instructions. It may occur when an instruction is executing and in such a case the instruction will get interrupted.

One important thing to note is that, while the main function runs in its own thread the signal handler also runs in its own thread. Both the threads belong to the same process though.

Edit: I misunderstood this line from The Linux Programming Interface, section 21.1.2:

    Because a signal handler may asynchronously interrupt the execution of a program at any point in time, the main program and the signal handler in effect form two independent (althought not concurrent) threads of execution within the same process.

I asked around on IRC[1] about this and it turns out that, “in effect” is the keyword here. It does not really create a thread for the signal handler. However, when a signal is delivered, the signal handler asynchronously interrupts a thread (in our case the main thread since we have a single threaded application). Once interrupted, the signal handler executes its own code, and the thread may resume execution unless the signal handler exits the program. The analogy to multiple threads helps to understand the flow of execution.
Signal handling

Now that we understand signals, let us run the code for the shell we had from Part II. If you run the executable and run the command sleep 10 in the shell and hit Ctrl-C before the command finishes, you will notice that along with the command, our shell has quit as well.

$ gcc -lreadline shell_with_builtin.c && ./a.out
unixsh> sleep 10
^C
$

You will notice the same behaviour if you hit Ctrl-Z as well, which generates the SIGTSTP signal. This stops the current running process. Currently, the shell is reacting to the default signal handlers set up by the operating system. The good news is that we can customize this behaviour. We can use the function signal() defined in signal.h:

#include <signal.h>

typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);

sighandler_t signal(int signum, sighandler_t handler);

The first argument to the function is the signal number. Each signal has a predefined integer value assigned to it. This number is 2 for SIGINT and 20 for SIGTSTP.

The second argument is a pointer to a signal handler. The signal handler is a function that must accept an int as the only parameter and return void as described by the typedef sighandler_t.

Let us write a minimal program to handle SIGINT:

sigint.c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>

void sigint_handler(int signo) {
    printf("Caught SIGINT\n");
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler);
    while (1);                  /* Infinite loop */
}

We run an infinite while loop here on typing Ctrl-C you will notice the text Caught SIGINT printed to the terminal, but the program will continue to run after that. You can stop it with Ctrl-Z. Here’s the output from a sample run:

$ gcc sigint.c && ./a.out
^CCaught SIGINT
^CCaught SIGINT
^Z
[2]+  Stopped                 ./a.out

C provides two very useful macros that can be passed to the signal function:

    SIG_IGN: Ignores the signal. Usage: signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN).
    SIG_DFL: Sets the default behaviour for the signal. This is useful when you want to reset the behaviour for a signal after having made some modifications. Usage: signal(SIGINT, SIG_DFL).

However, it is not possible to ignore, block or setup a custom handler for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP. Blocking a signal means that the signal will not be delivered to the process at all.

We will now use signal handling in our shell and modify our code by adding a call to signal() just before the while loop:

...
int main() {
    ...
    signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN);
    
    while (1) {
    
...

The modified file is available here. If you compile and execute the binary and hit Ctrl-C, the shell does not quit anymore. But if you run sleep 10 in the shell and hit Ctrl-C, the command does not quit as well. The reason behind this is that when a fork is called, apart from duplicating the parent process, it copies the current signal configurations (also known as the signal dispositions) as well. Since we are ignoring SIGINT in the parent, the child also inherits the same property for SIGINT from its parent and conveninently ignores the keyboard interrupt (Ctrl-C).

To prevent this, we will restore the default behaviour of SIGINT in the child process after fork. Note that this must be done before the call to execvp since it will replace the current program with the program passed in the command.

...
        child_pid = fork();
        ...
        if (child_pid == 0) {
            signal(SIGINT, SIG_DFL);

            /* Never returns if the call is successful */
            if (execvp(command[0], command) < 0) {
...

The modified file is available here.
Signal masks

Each process has an attribute called the process signal mask which is maintained by the kernel. Any signal that is added to the signal mask gets blocked from being delivered in the future, unless the signal is removed from it. This is useful when we want to block a signal based on the application logic.

Now, let’s look at the following workflow for an example:

    A signal is delivered. The signal handler gets invoked and is in the middle of executing some instructions.
    The same signal is delivered again and the signal handler is invoked once again. The previous instance of the signal handler will get interrupted by a new instance of the signal handler.

This is not very desirable. To prevent the signal handler from interrupting itself, the original signal that invoked the signal handler gets added to the signal mask by default. This means that the same signal will not interrupt the current instance of the signal handler. And once the signal handler returns, the signal is removed from the mask.
Non local jumps

Currently, the shell does not do anything when it encounters a Ctrl-C, while waiting for a command input. We would like to change this behaviour to restart the while loop from the top and print a newline. Effectively, Ctrl-C would mean a soft reset of the command line. This brings us to the functions setjmp and longjmp, which are used to perform a non local jump. This is equivalent of using a goto statement to jump across scopes, except that the scope of a goto is restricted to within a function. These functions are defined in setjmp.h and their signatures look like this:

int setjmp(jmp_buf env);

The setjmp() function sets a jump point and takes a buffer of type jmp_buf which is used to store details like the stack pointer and the instruction pointer. It returns 0 once the jump point has been set.

void longjmp(jmp_buf env, int val);

The longjmp() function uses the buffer which contains values saved by setjmp() to determine the jump point in the program. Additionally it takes an integer value, which is returned when the code returns to the jump point. Here’s an example:

setjmp_longjmp.c


	

#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <setjmp.h>
#include <unistd.h>

static jmp_buf env;

void sigint_handler(int signo) {
    longjmp(env, 42);
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler);
    while (1){                  /* Infinite loop */
        if (setjmp(env) == 42) {
            printf("Restart.\n");
        }
        printf("next iteration...\n");
        sleep(2);
    }
}

A few important things to note about the code above:

    The call to signal() takes a pointer to the sigint_handler() function instead of SIG_IGN (line 13).
    When the code reaches line 15 for the first time, setjmp() is invoked and returns 0.
    After the signal handler has been registered, if we type Ctrl-C, the longjmp() function call is invoked where we pass 42 to it. The code jumps to line 15 and this time setjmp() returns the value that was passed in longjmp() on line 9, i.e. 42. Thus the check evaluates to true, which signifies that we reached this code from a non local jump. This is also referred to as a fake return by setjmp().

If you compile and execute the binary, the output would be similar to:

$ gcc -lreadline -g setjmp_longjmp.c && ./a.out
next iteration...
^CRestart.
next iteration...
^Cnext iteration...
next iteration...
^Z
[6]+  Stopped                 ./a.out

But, Restart will be printed to the screen only the first time you hit Ctrl-C. The reason behind this is that the first time the signal handler is invoked for SIGINT, it blocks the signal and the call to longjmp() does not unblock the signal since the signal handler never really returns. As a result, SIGINT does not get delivered after the first time.

To fix this problem, we have sigsetjmp() and siglongjmp(). The function signatures are:

int sigsetjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int savesigs);

void siglongjmp(sigjmp_buf env, int val);

They are similar to setjmp() and longjmp(), but they accept a buffer of type sigjmp_buf instead of jmp_buf. Also, the sigsetjmp() function accepts a flag savesigs. If value of this flag is non zero, then sigsetjmp() saves the current process signal mask and restores it when siglongjmp() is invoked. This means, that the signal which initially gets blocked on invoking the signal handler, gets unblocked as soon as siglongjmp() is invoked.

And here’s an example using these functions:

sigsetjmp_siglongjmp.c


	

#include <stdio.h>
#include <signal.h>
#include <setjmp.h>
#include <unistd.h>

static sigjmp_buf env;

void sigint_handler(int signo) {
    siglongjmp(env, 42);
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler);
    while (1){                  /* Infinite loop */
        if (sigsetjmp(env, 1) == 42) {
            printf("Restart.\n");
        }
        printf("next iteration...\n");
        sleep(2);
    }
}

Note that the function call to sigsetjmp() on line 15 accepts an extra parameter for the savesigs flag. Also, env is of type sigjmp_buf. And if you compile and execute it you will notice that Ctrl-C is accepted more than once, until you stop the program:

$ gcc -lreadline -g sigsetjmp_siglongjmp.c && ./a.out
next iteration...
^CRestart.
next iteration...
^CRestart.
next iteration...
^Z
[7]+  Stopped                 ./a.out

There’s one last catch about this arrangement though. We setup the signal handler before setting a jump point. But there is no guarantee that a signal will only be delivered after the jump point has been set. And if this scenario takes place, our program will crash. To avoid this we add a global flag that is false by default. Once the jump point has been set, we set the flag to true and add a check on this flag in our signal handler. If the flag is false, we skip the call to longjmp() and return from the handler instead. Here’s our updated signal handler and main function:

sigsetjmp_siglongjmp_with_check.c

...
static volatile sig_atomic_t jump_active = 0;

void sigint_handler(int signo) {
    if (!jump_active) {
        return;
    }
    siglongjmp(env, 42);
}

int main() {
    signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler);
    while (1){                  /* Infinite loop */
        if (sigsetjmp(env, 1) == 42) {
            printf("Restart.\n");
        }
        jump_active = 1;        /* Set the flag */
        printf("next iteration...\n");
        sleep(2);
    }
}

The flag jump_active is of type volatile sig_atomic_t. This is essential, since this flag will be accessed asynchronously by multiple threads of the process, i.e. the main thread and the signal handler thread. The type guarantees atomic access to the variable across multiple threads.

This brings us back to the first example, sigint.c where we used printf in the signal handler. printf is an async unsafe function. Which means, that if the signal handler is invoked while another printf is executing in a different part of the program, the output may be erratic. We use printf only to explain the concept here, and it should not be used in real life applications.
A better way for signal handling: sigaction

So far we have used the signal() function for setting signal handlers. However, its implementation differs from system to system and is generally not recommended to be used directly in application code since its usage makes portability hard. The alternative is to use the sigaction() function call.

This is also defined in signal.h, but before we look at its signature, lets look at the definition of the struct sigaction (yes, sadly they are both named the same):

struct sigaction {
    void     (*sa_handler)(int);
    void     (*sa_sigaction)(int, siginfo_t *, void *);
    sigset_t   sa_mask;
    int        sa_flags;
    void     (*sa_restorer)(void);
};

The struct requires:

    sa_handler: A pointer to the signal handler.
    sa_sigaction: A pointer to a signal handler that can access more information regarding the signal. Either one of sa_handler or sa_sigaction should be used.
    sa_mask: An optional set of signals which are blocked while the signal handler is executing.
    sa_flags: A bitwise OR of config flags.
    sa_restorer: This is for internal use and should not be set.

Now let us look at the signature of the sigaction() function:

int sigaction(int signum, const struct sigaction *act, struct sigaction *oldact);

It accepts the signal number and two sigaction struct objects. The first contains new configuration to be set, while the second is used to save the current configuration before overwriting it with the new one.

In our previous code, we replace signal(SIGINT, signal_handler by:

    struct sigaction s;
    s.sa_handler = sigint_handler;
    sigemptyset(&s.sa_mask);
    s.sa_flags = SA_RESTART;
    sigaction(SIGINT, &s, NULL);

The sigemptyset() function initializes the sa_mask attribute of the struct with an empty set. We set the SA_RESTART flag on the struct, which implies that if the signal handler is invoked while the program is in the middle of a system call, the system call will be restarted after the signal handler has finished its execution. And finally, we call the sigaction() function with the signal and the sigaction struct. We do not care about the previous configuration for the signal and pass NULL instead of another sigaction struct object. The example is available here.
One last trivia

During this exercise contrary to my belief I realized that on typing Ctrl-D no signal is generated like it does when we type Ctrl-C. Rather it sends the EOF character. Since we’ve changed Ctrl-C to not quit the shell, we implement Ctrl-D to do that instead for us, which is similar to the behaviour of bash. The following snippet helps us do this:

...
        input = readline("rcsh> ");
        if (input == NULL) {  /* Exit on Ctrl-D */
            printf("\n");
            exit(0);
        }
...

The code for the shell with the concepts explained above is available here, but it is recommended that readers try to implement it themselves.

That brings us to the end of part III. All the code examples shown in this blog post are available here. In the next blog post we will see how to run background commands and perform job control. Stay tuned.

ABSOLUT RELATIVE PATH




Path differences in Linux
Linux absolute path

/home/users/c/computerhope/public_html/cgi-bin

Linux relative path

./public_html/cgi-bin

In the example above, the absolute path contains the full path to the cgi-bin directory on that computer.

The relative path begins with a dot (period), representing the current directory (also called the "working directory"). The relative path ./public_html/cgi-bin is valid only if the current directory contains a path named public_html which contains a directory named cgi-bin.
How to find the absolute path of a file in Linux

Since most users do not want to see the full path as their prompt, it is relative to their personal directory as shown above. To find the full absolute path of the current directory, use the pwd command.

Once you've determined the path to the current directory, the absolute path to the file is the path plus the name of the file. For example, if in the cgi-bin directory we had a file called "example.cgi," the absolute system path to the file is "/home/users/c/computerhope/public_html/cgi-bin/example.cgi".
How to find the absolute path of a file in Linux for a web page

When working on a Linux computer used as a web server to show web pages on the Internet. It can be confusing to know what to use for the relative and absolute path. We've found that most of this confusion comes from not understanding that the root directory for your web page is the public_html directory.

In the absolute path example shown above, when linking files online, the absolute path would start with "public_html/" which would make the absolute path "public_html/cgi-bin" for the cgi-bin directory.































signals and traps




n this chapter, we will discuss in detail about Signals and Traps in Unix.

Signals are software interrupts sent to a program to indicate that an important event has occurred. The events can vary from user requests to illegal memory access errors. Some signals, such as the interrupt signal, indicate that a user has asked the program to do something that is not in the usual flow of control.

The following table lists out common signals you might encounter and want to use in your programs −
Signal Name 	Signal Number 	Description
SIGHUP 	1 	Hang up detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process
SIGINT 	2 	Issued if the user sends an interrupt signal (Ctrl + C)
SIGQUIT 	3 	Issued if the user sends a quit signal (Ctrl + D)
SIGFPE 	8 	Issued if an illegal mathematical operation is attempted
SIGKILL 	9 	If a process gets this signal it must quit immediately and will not perform any clean-up operations
SIGALRM 	14 	Alarm clock signal (used for timers)
SIGTERM 	15 	Software termination signal (sent by kill by default)
List of Signals

There is an easy way to list down all the signals supported by your system. Just issue the kill -l command and it would display all the supported signals −

$ kill -l
 1) SIGHUP       2) SIGINT       3) SIGQUIT      4) SIGILL
 5) SIGTRAP      6) SIGABRT      7) SIGBUS       8) SIGFPE
 9) SIGKILL     10) SIGUSR1     11) SIGSEGV     12) SIGUSR2
13) SIGPIPE     14) SIGALRM     15) SIGTERM     16) SIGSTKFLT
17) SIGCHLD     18) SIGCONT     19) SIGSTOP     20) SIGTSTP
21) SIGTTIN     22) SIGTTOU     23) SIGURG      24) SIGXCPU
25) SIGXFSZ     26) SIGVTALRM   27) SIGPROF     28) SIGWINCH
29) SIGIO       30) SIGPWR      31) SIGSYS      34) SIGRTMIN
35) SIGRTMIN+1  36) SIGRTMIN+2  37) SIGRTMIN+3  38) SIGRTMIN+4
39) SIGRTMIN+5  40) SIGRTMIN+6  41) SIGRTMIN+7  42) SIGRTMIN+8
43) SIGRTMIN+9  44) SIGRTMIN+10 45) SIGRTMIN+11 46) SIGRTMIN+12
47) SIGRTMIN+13 48) SIGRTMIN+14 49) SIGRTMIN+15 50) SIGRTMAX-14
51) SIGRTMAX-13 52) SIGRTMAX-12 53) SIGRTMAX-11 54) SIGRTMAX-10
55) SIGRTMAX-9  56) SIGRTMAX-8  57) SIGRTMAX-7  58) SIGRTMAX-6
59) SIGRTMAX-5  60) SIGRTMAX-4  61) SIGRTMAX-3  62) SIGRTMAX-2
63) SIGRTMAX-1  64) SIGRTMAX

The actual list of signals varies between Solaris, HP-UX, and Linux.
Default Actions

Every signal has a default action associated with it. The default action for a signal is the action that a script or program performs when it receives a signal.

Some of the possible default actions are −

    Terminate the process.

    Ignore the signal.

    Dump core. This creates a file called core containing the memory image of the process when it received the signal.

    Stop the process.

    Continue a stopped process.

Sending Signals

There are several methods of delivering signals to a program or script. One of the most common is for a user to type CONTROL-C or the INTERRUPT key while a script is executing.

When you press the Ctrl+C key, a SIGINT is sent to the script and as per defined default action script terminates.

The other common method for delivering signals is to use the kill command, the syntax of which is as follows −

$ kill -signal pid

Here signal is either the number or name of the signal to deliver and pid is the process ID that the signal should be sent to. For Example −

$ kill -1 1001

The above command sends the HUP or hang-up signal to the program that is running with process ID 1001. To send a kill signal to the same process, use the following command −

$ kill -9 1001

This kills the process running with process ID 1001.
Trapping Signals

When you press the Ctrl+C or Break key at your terminal during execution of a shell program, normally that program is immediately terminated, and your command prompt returns. This may not always be desirable. For instance, you may end up leaving a bunch of temporary files that won't get cleaned up.

Trapping these signals is quite easy, and the trap command has the following syntax −

$ trap commands signals

Here command can be any valid Unix command, or even a user-defined function, and signal can be a list of any number of signals you want to trap.

There are two common uses for trap in shell scripts −

    Clean up temporary files
    Ignore signals

Cleaning Up Temporary Files

As an example of the trap command, the following shows how you can remove some files and then exit if someone tries to abort the program from the terminal −

$ trap "rm -f $WORKDIR/work1$$ $WORKDIR/dataout$$; exit" 2

From the point in the shell program that this trap is executed, the two files work1$$ and dataout$$ will be automatically removed if signal number 2 is received by the program.

Hence, if the user interrupts the execution of the program after this trap is executed, you can be assured that these two files will be cleaned up. The exit command that follows the rm is necessary because without it, the execution would continue in the program at the point that it left off when the signal was received.

Signal number 1 is generated for hangup. Either someone intentionally hangs up the line or the line gets accidentally disconnected.

You can modify the preceding trap to also remove the two specified files in this case by adding signal number 1 to the list of signals −

$ trap "rm $WORKDIR/work1$$ $WORKDIR/dataout$$; exit" 1 2

Now these files will be removed if the line gets hung up or if the Ctrl+C key gets pressed.

The commands specified to trap must be enclosed in quotes, if they contain more than one command. Also note that the shell scans the command line at the time that the trap command gets executed and also when one of the listed signals is received.

Thus, in the preceding example, the value of WORKDIR and $$ will be substituted at the time that the trap command is executed. If you wanted this substitution to occur at the time that either signal 1 or 2 was received, you can put the commands inside single quotes −

$ trap 'rm $WORKDIR/work1$$ $WORKDIR/dataout$$; exit' 1 2

Ignoring Signals

If the command listed for trap is null, the specified signal will be ignored when received. For example, the command −

$ trap '' 2

This specifies that the interrupt signal is to be ignored. You might want to ignore certain signals when performing an operation that you don't want to be interrupted. You can specify multiple signals to be ignored as follows −

$ trap '' 1 2 3 15

Note that the first argument must be specified for a signal to be ignored and is not equivalent to writing the following, which has a separate meaning of its own −

$ trap  2

If you ignore a signal, all subshells also ignore that signal. However, if you specify an action to be taken on the receipt of a signal, all subshells will still take the default action on receipt of that signal.
Resetting Traps

After you've changed the default action to be taken on receipt of a signal, you can change it back again with the trap if you simply omit the first argument; so −

$ trap 1 2

This resets the action to be taken on the receipt of signals 1 or 2 back to the default.

 2. Shell Command Language

This chapter contains the definition of the Shell Command Language.
2.1 Shell Introduction

The shell is a command language interpreter. This chapter describes the syntax of that command language as it is used by the sh utility and the system() and popen() functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

The shell operates according to the following general overview of operations. The specific details are included in the cited sections of this chapter.

    The shell reads its input from a file (see sh), from the -c option or from the system() and popen() functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the first line of a file of shell commands starts with the characters "#!", the results are unspecified.

    The shell breaks the input into tokens: words and operators; see Token Recognition.

    The shell parses the input into simple commands (see Simple Commands) and compound commands (see Compound Commands).

    The shell performs various expansions (separately) on different parts of each command, resulting in a list of pathnames and fields to be treated as a command and arguments; see Word Expansions.

    The shell performs redirection (see Redirection) and removes redirection operators and their operands from the parameter list.

    The shell executes a function (see Function Definition Command), built-in (see Special Built-In Utilities), executable file, or script, giving the names of the arguments as positional parameters numbered 1 to n, and the name of the command (or in the case of a function within a script, the name of the script) as the positional parameter numbered 0 (see Command Search and Execution).

    The shell optionally waits for the command to complete and collects the exit status (see Exit Status for Commands).

2.2 Quoting

Quoting is used to remove the special meaning of certain characters or words to the shell. Quoting can be used to preserve the literal meaning of the special characters in the next paragraph, prevent reserved words from being recognized as such, and prevent parameter expansion and command substitution within here-document processing (see Here-Document).

The application shall quote the following characters if they are to represent themselves:

    |  &  ;  <  >  (  )  $  `  \  "  '  <space>  <tab>  <newline>

and the following may need to be quoted under certain circumstances. That is, these characters may be special depending on conditions described elsewhere in this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001:

    *   ?   [   #   ˜   =   %

The various quoting mechanisms are the escape character, single-quotes, and double-quotes. The here-document represents another form of quoting; see Here-Document.
2.2.1 Escape Character (Backslash)

A backslash that is not quoted shall preserve the literal value of the following character, with the exception of a <newline>. If a <newline> follows the backslash, the shell shall interpret this as line continuation. The backslash and <newline>s shall be removed before splitting the input into tokens. Since the escaped <newline> is removed entirely from the input and is not replaced by any white space, it cannot serve as a token separator.
2.2.2 Single-Quotes

Enclosing characters in single-quotes ( '' ) shall preserve the literal value of each character within the single-quotes. A single-quote cannot occur within single-quotes.
2.2.3 Double-Quotes

Enclosing characters in double-quotes ( "" ) shall preserve the literal value of all characters within the double-quotes, with the exception of the characters dollar sign, backquote, and backslash, as follows:

$
    The dollar sign shall retain its special meaning introducing parameter expansion (see Parameter Expansion), a form of command substitution (see Command Substitution), and arithmetic expansion (see Arithmetic Expansion).

    The input characters within the quoted string that are also enclosed between "$(" and the matching ')' shall not be affected by the double-quotes, but rather shall define that command whose output replaces the "$(...)" when the word is expanded. The tokenizing rules in Token Recognition , not including the alias substitutions in Alias Substitution , shall be applied recursively to find the matching ')'.

    Within the string of characters from an enclosed "${" to the matching '}', an even number of unescaped double-quotes or single-quotes, if any, shall occur. A preceding backslash character shall be used to escape a literal '{' or '}'. The rule in Parameter Expansion shall be used to determine the matching '}' .
`
    The backquote shall retain its special meaning introducing the other form of command substitution (see Command Substitution). The portion of the quoted string from the initial backquote and the characters up to the next backquote that is not preceded by a backslash, having escape characters removed, defines that command whose output replaces "`...`" when the word is expanded. Either of the following cases produces undefined results:

        A single-quoted or double-quoted string that begins, but does not end, within the "`...`" sequence

        A "`...`" sequence that begins, but does not end, within the same double-quoted string

\
    The backslash shall retain its special meaning as an escape character (see Escape Character (Backslash)) only when followed by one of the following characters when considered special:

        $   `   "   \   <newline>

The application shall ensure that a double-quote is preceded by a backslash to be included within double-quotes. The parameter '@' has special meaning inside double-quotes and is described in Special Parameters.
2.3 Token Recognition

The shell shall read its input in terms of lines from a file, from a terminal in the case of an interactive shell, or from a string in the case of sh -c or system(). The input lines can be of unlimited length. These lines shall be parsed using two major modes: ordinary token recognition and processing of here-documents.

When an io_here token has been recognized by the grammar (see Shell Grammar), one or more of the subsequent lines immediately following the next NEWLINE token form the body of one or more here-documents and shall be parsed according to the rules of Here-Document.

When it is not processing an io_here, the shell shall break its input into tokens by applying the first applicable rule below to the next character in its input. The token shall be from the current position in the input until a token is delimited according to one of the rules below; the characters forming the token are exactly those in the input, including any quoting characters. If it is indicated that a token is delimited, and no characters have been included in a token, processing shall continue until an actual token is delimited.

    If the end of input is recognized, the current token shall be delimited. If there is no current token, the end-of-input indicator shall be returned as the token.

    If the previous character was used as part of an operator and the current character is not quoted and can be used with the current characters to form an operator, it shall be used as part of that (operator) token.

    If the previous character was used as part of an operator and the current character cannot be used with the current characters to form an operator, the operator containing the previous character shall be delimited.

    If the current character is backslash, single-quote, or double-quote ( '\', '", or ' )' and it is not quoted, it shall affect quoting for subsequent characters up to the end of the quoted text. The rules for quoting are as described in Quoting. During token recognition no substitutions shall be actually performed, and the result token shall contain exactly the characters that appear in the input (except for <newline> joining), unmodified, including any embedded or enclosing quotes or substitution operators, between the quote mark and the end of the quoted text. The token shall not be delimited by the end of the quoted field.

    If the current character is an unquoted '$' or '`', the shell shall identify the start of any candidates for parameter expansion ( Parameter Expansion), command substitution ( Command Substitution), or arithmetic expansion ( Arithmetic Expansion) from their introductory unquoted character sequences: '$' or "${", "$(" or '`', and "$((", respectively. The shell shall read sufficient input to determine the end of the unit to be expanded (as explained in the cited sections). While processing the characters, if instances of expansions or quoting are found nested within the substitution, the shell shall recursively process them in the manner specified for the construct that is found. The characters found from the beginning of the substitution to its end, allowing for any recursion necessary to recognize embedded constructs, shall be included unmodified in the result token, including any embedded or enclosing substitution operators or quotes. The token shall not be delimited by the end of the substitution.

    If the current character is not quoted and can be used as the first character of a new operator, the current token (if any) shall be delimited. The current character shall be used as the beginning of the next (operator) token.

    If the current character is an unquoted <newline>, the current token shall be delimited.

    If the current character is an unquoted <blank>, any token containing the previous character is delimited and the current character shall be discarded.

    If the previous character was part of a word, the current character shall be appended to that word.

    If the current character is a '#', it and all subsequent characters up to, but excluding, the next <newline> shall be discarded as a comment. The <newline> that ends the line is not considered part of the comment.

    The current character is used as the start of a new word.

Once a token is delimited, it is categorized as required by the grammar in Shell Grammar.
2.3.1 Alias Substitution

[UP XSI] [Option Start] The processing of aliases shall be supported on all XSI-conformant systems or if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option (and the rest of this section is not further marked for these options). [Option End]

After a token has been delimited, but before applying the grammatical rules in Shell Grammar , a resulting word that is identified to be the command name word of a simple command shall be examined to determine whether it is an unquoted, valid alias name. However, reserved words in correct grammatical context shall not be candidates for alias substitution. A valid alias name (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.10, Alias Name) shall be one that has been defined by the alias utility and not subsequently undefined using unalias. Implementations also may provide predefined valid aliases that are in effect when the shell is invoked. To prevent infinite loops in recursive aliasing, if the shell is not currently processing an alias of the same name, the word shall be replaced by the value of the alias; otherwise, it shall not be replaced.

If the value of the alias replacing the word ends in a <blank>, the shell shall check the next command word for alias substitution; this process shall continue until a word is found that is not a valid alias or an alias value does not end in a <blank>.

When used as specified by this volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, alias definitions shall not be inherited by separate invocations of the shell or by the utility execution environments invoked by the shell; see Shell Execution Environment.
2.4 Reserved Words

Reserved words are words that have special meaning to the shell; see Shell Commands. The following words shall be recognized as reserved words:


    !
    {
    }
    case
    	


    do
    done
    elif
    else
    	


    esac
    fi
    for
    if
    	


    in
    then
    until
    while

This recognition shall only occur when none of the characters is quoted and when the word is used as:

    The first word of a command

    The first word following one of the reserved words other than case, for, or in

    The third word in a case command (only in is valid in this case)

    The third word in a for command (only in and do are valid in this case)

See the grammar in Shell Grammar.

The following words may be recognized as reserved words on some implementations (when none of the characters are quoted), causing unspecified results:

    [[
    	

    ]]
    	

    function
    	

    select

Words that are the concatenation of a name and a colon ( ':' ) are reserved; their use produces unspecified results.
2.5 Parameters and Variables

A parameter can be denoted by a name, a number, or one of the special characters listed in Special Parameters. A variable is a parameter denoted by a name.

A parameter is set if it has an assigned value (null is a valid value). Once a variable is set, it can only be unset by using the unset special built-in command.
2.5.1 Positional Parameters

A positional parameter is a parameter denoted by the decimal value represented by one or more digits, other than the single digit 0. The digits denoting the positional parameters shall always be interpreted as a decimal value, even if there is a leading zero. When a positional parameter with more than one digit is specified, the application shall enclose the digits in braces (see Parameter Expansion). Positional parameters are initially assigned when the shell is invoked (see sh), temporarily replaced when a shell function is invoked (see Function Definition Command), and can be reassigned with the set special built-in command.
2.5.2 Special Parameters

Listed below are the special parameters and the values to which they shall expand. Only the values of the special parameters are listed; see Word Expansions for a detailed summary of all the stages involved in expanding words.

@
    Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within double-quotes, and where field splitting (see Field Splitting) is performed, each positional parameter shall expand as a separate field, with the provision that the expansion of the first parameter shall still be joined with the beginning part of the original word (assuming that the expanded parameter was embedded within a word), and the expansion of the last parameter shall still be joined with the last part of the original word. If there are no positional parameters, the expansion of '@' shall generate zero fields, even when '@' is double-quoted.
*
    Expands to the positional parameters, starting from one. When the expansion occurs within a double-quoted string (see Double-Quotes), it shall expand to a single field with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS variable, or by a <space> if IFS is unset. If IFS is set to a null string, this is not equivalent to unsetting it; its first character does not exist, so the parameter values are concatenated.
#
    Expands to the decimal number of positional parameters. The command name (parameter 0) shall not be counted in the number given by '#' because it is a special parameter, not a positional parameter.
?
    Expands to the decimal exit status of the most recent pipeline (see Pipelines).
-
    (Hyphen.) Expands to the current option flags (the single-letter option names concatenated into a string) as specified on invocation, by the set special built-in command, or implicitly by the shell.
$
    Expands to the decimal process ID of the invoked shell. In a subshell (see Shell Execution Environment ), '$' shall expand to the same value as that of the current shell.
!
    Expands to the decimal process ID of the most recent background command (see Lists) executed from the current shell. (For example, background commands executed from subshells do not affect the value of "$!" in the current shell environment.) For a pipeline, the process ID is that of the last command in the pipeline.
0
    (Zero.) Expands to the name of the shell or shell script. See sh for a detailed description of how this name is derived.

See the description of the IFS variable in Shell Variables.
2.5.3 Shell Variables

Variables shall be initialized from the environment (as defined by the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables and the exec function in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001) and can be given new values with variable assignment commands. If a variable is initialized from the environment, it shall be marked for export immediately; see the export special built-in. New variables can be defined and initialized with variable assignments, with the read or getopts utilities, with the name parameter in a for loop, with the ${ name= word} expansion, or with other mechanisms provided as implementation extensions.

The following variables shall affect the execution of the shell:

ENV
    [UP XSI] [Option Start] The processing of the ENV shell variable shall be supported on all XSI-conformant systems or if the system supports the User Portability Utilities option. [Option End]

    This variable, when and only when an interactive shell is invoked, shall be subjected to parameter expansion (see Parameter Expansion) by the shell and the resulting value shall be used as a pathname of a file containing shell commands to execute in the current environment. The file need not be executable. If the expanded value of ENV is not an absolute pathname, the results are unspecified. ENV shall be ignored if the user's real and effective user IDs or real and effective group IDs are different.
HOME
    The pathname of the user's home directory. The contents of HOME are used in tilde expansion (see Tilde Expansion).
IFS
    (Input Field Separators.) A string treated as a list of characters that is used for field splitting and to split lines into fields with the read command. If IFS is not set, the shell shall behave as if the value of IFS is <space>, <tab>, and <newline>; see Field Splitting. Implementations may ignore the value of IFS in the environment at the time the shell is invoked, treating IFS as if it were not set.
LANG
    Provide a default value for the internationalization variables that are unset or null. (See the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 8.2, Internationalization Variables for the precedence of internationalization variables used to determine the values of locale categories.)
LC_ALL
    The value of this variable overrides the LC_* variables and LANG , as described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.
LC_COLLATE
    Determine the behavior of range expressions, equivalence classes, and multi-character collating elements within pattern matching.
LC_CTYPE
    Determine the interpretation of sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte characters), which characters are defined as letters (character class alpha) and <blank>s (character class blank), and the behavior of character classes within pattern matching. Changing the value of LC_CTYPE after the shell has started shall not affect the lexical processing of shell commands in the current shell execution environment or its subshells. Invoking a shell script or performing exec sh subjects the new shell to the changes in LC_CTYPE .
LC_MESSAGES
    Determine the language in which messages should be written.
LINENO
    Set by the shell to a decimal number representing the current sequential line number (numbered starting with 1) within a script or function before it executes each command. If the user unsets or resets LINENO , the variable may lose its special meaning for the life of the shell. If the shell is not currently executing a script or function, the value of LINENO is unspecified. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of the variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.
NLSPATH
    [XSI] [Option Start] Determine the location of message catalogs for the processing of LC_MESSAGES . [Option End]
PATH
    A string formatted as described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables, used to effect command interpretation; see Command Search and Execution.
PPID
    Set by the shell to the decimal process ID of the process that invoked this shell. In a subshell (see Shell Execution Environment), PPID shall be set to the same value as that of the parent of the current shell. For example, echo $ PPID and ( echo $ PPID ) would produce the same value. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of the variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.
PS1
    Each time an interactive shell is ready to read a command, the value of this variable shall be subjected to parameter expansion and written to standard error. The default value shall be "$ ". For users who have specific additional implementation-defined privileges, the default may be another, implementation-defined value. The shell shall replace each instance of the character '!' in PS1 with the history file number of the next command to be typed. Escaping the '!' with another '!' (that is, "!!" ) shall place the literal character '!' in the prompt. This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of the variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.
PS2
    Each time the user enters a <newline> prior to completing a command line in an interactive shell, the value of this variable shall be subjected to parameter expansion and written to standard error. The default value is "> ". This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of the variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.
PS4
    When an execution trace ( set -x) is being performed in an interactive shell, before each line in the execution trace, the value of this variable shall be subjected to parameter expansion and written to standard error. The default value is "+ ". This volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 specifies the effects of the variable only for systems supporting the User Portability Utilities option.
PWD
    Set by the shell to be an absolute pathname of the current working directory, containing no components of type symbolic link, no components that are dot, and no components that are dot-dot when the shell is initialized. If an application sets or unsets the value of PWD , the behaviors of the cd and pwd utilities are unspecified.

2.6 Word Expansions

This section describes the various expansions that are performed on words. Not all expansions are performed on every word, as explained in the following sections.

Tilde expansions, parameter expansions, command substitutions, arithmetic expansions, and quote removals that occur within a single word expand to a single field. It is only field splitting or pathname expansion that can create multiple fields from a single word. The single exception to this rule is the expansion of the special parameter '@' within double-quotes, as described in Special Parameters.

The order of word expansion shall be as follows:

    Tilde expansion (see Tilde Expansion), parameter expansion (see Parameter Expansion), command substitution (see Command Substitution), and arithmetic expansion (see Arithmetic Expansion) shall be performed, beginning to end. See item 5 in Token Recognition.

    Field splitting (see Field Splitting) shall be performed on the portions of the fields generated by step 1, unless IFS is null.

    Pathname expansion (see Pathname Expansion) shall be performed, unless set -f is in effect.

    Quote removal (see Quote Removal) shall always be performed last.

The expansions described in this section shall occur in the same shell environment as that in which the command is executed.

If the complete expansion appropriate for a word results in an empty field, that empty field shall be deleted from the list of fields that form the completely expanded command, unless the original word contained single-quote or double-quote characters.

The '$' character is used to introduce parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic evaluation. If an unquoted '$' is followed by a character that is either not numeric, the name of one of the special parameters (see Special Parameters), a valid first character of a variable name, a left curly brace ( '{' ) or a left parenthesis, the result is unspecified.
2.6.1 Tilde Expansion

A "tilde-prefix" consists of an unquoted tilde character at the beginning of a word, followed by all of the characters preceding the first unquoted slash in the word, or all the characters in the word if there is no slash. In an assignment (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 4.21, Variable Assignment), multiple tilde-prefixes can be used: at the beginning of the word (that is, following the equal sign of the assignment), following any unquoted colon, or both. A tilde-prefix in an assignment is terminated by the first unquoted colon or slash. If none of the characters in the tilde-prefix are quoted, the characters in the tilde-prefix following the tilde are treated as a possible login name from the user database. A portable login name cannot contain characters outside the set given in the description of the LOGNAME environment variable in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 8.3, Other Environment Variables. If the login name is null (that is, the tilde-prefix contains only the tilde), the tilde-prefix is replaced by the value of the variable HOME . If HOME is unset, the results are unspecified. Otherwise, the tilde-prefix shall be replaced by a pathname of the initial working directory associated with the login name obtained using the getpwnam() function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001. If the system does not recognize the login name, the results are undefined.
2.6.2 Parameter Expansion

The format for parameter expansion is as follows:

    ${expression}

where expression consists of all characters until the matching '}'. Any '}' escaped by a backslash or within a quoted string, and characters in embedded arithmetic expansions, command substitutions, and variable expansions, shall not be examined in determining the matching '}'.

The simplest form for parameter expansion is:

    ${parameter}

The value, if any, of parameter shall be substituted.

The parameter name or symbol can be enclosed in braces, which are optional except for positional parameters with more than one digit or when parameter is followed by a character that could be interpreted as part of the name. The matching closing brace shall be determined by counting brace levels, skipping over enclosed quoted strings, and command substitutions.

If the parameter name or symbol is not enclosed in braces, the expansion shall use the longest valid name (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.230, Name), whether or not the symbol represented by that name exists.

If a parameter expansion occurs inside double-quotes:

    Pathname expansion shall not be performed on the results of the expansion.

    Field splitting shall not be performed on the results of the expansion, with the exception of '@' ; see Special Parameters.

In addition, a parameter expansion can be modified by using one of the following formats. In each case that a value of word is needed (based on the state of parameter, as described below), word shall be subjected to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. If word is not needed, it shall not be expanded. The '}' character that delimits the following parameter expansion modifications shall be determined as described previously in this section and in Double-Quotes. (For example, ${ foo-bar} xyz} would result in the expansion of foo followed by the string xyz} if foo is set, else the string "barxyz}" ).

${parameter:-word}
    Use Default Values. If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word shall be substituted; otherwise, the value of parameter shall be substituted.
${parameter:=word}
    Assign Default Values. If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word shall be assigned to parameter. In all cases, the final value of parameter shall be substituted. Only variables, not positional parameters or special parameters, can be assigned in this way.
${parameter:?[word]}
    Indicate Error if Null or Unset. If parameter is unset or null, the expansion of word (or a message indicating it is unset if word is omitted) shall be written to standard error and the shell exits with a non-zero exit status. Otherwise, the value of parameter shall be substituted. An interactive shell need not exit.
${parameter:+word}
    Use Alternative Value. If parameter is unset or null, null shall be substituted; otherwise, the expansion of word shall be substituted.

In the parameter expansions shown previously, use of the colon in the format shall result in a test for a parameter that is unset or null; omission of the colon shall result in a test for a parameter that is only unset. The following table summarizes the effect of the colon:

 
	

parameter
	

parameter
	

parameter

 
	

Set and Not Null
	

Set But Null
	

Unset

${parameter:-word}
	

substitute parameter
	

substitute word
	

substitute word

${parameter-word}
	

substitute parameter
	

substitute null
	

substitute word

${parameter:=word}
	

substitute parameter
	

assign word
	

assign word

${parameter=word}
	

substitute parameter
	

substitute null
	

assign word

${parameter:?word}
	

substitute parameter
	

error, exit
	

error, exit

${parameter?word}
	

substitute parameter
	

substitute null
	

error, exit

${parameter:+word}
	

substitute word
	

substitute null
	

substitute null

${parameter+word}
	

substitute word
	

substitute word
	

substitute null

In all cases shown with "substitute", the expression is replaced with the value shown. In all cases shown with "assign", parameter is assigned that value, which also replaces the expression.

${#parameter}
    String Length. The length in characters of the value of parameter shall be substituted. If parameter is '*' or '@', the result of the expansion is unspecified.

The following four varieties of parameter expansion provide for substring processing. In each case, pattern matching notation (see Pattern Matching Notation), rather than regular expression notation, shall be used to evaluate the patterns. If parameter is '*' or '@', the result of the expansion is unspecified. Enclosing the full parameter expansion string in double-quotes shall not cause the following four varieties of pattern characters to be quoted, whereas quoting characters within the braces shall have this effect.

${parameter%word}
    Remove Smallest Suffix Pattern. The word shall be expanded to produce a pattern. The parameter expansion shall then result in parameter, with the smallest portion of the suffix matched by the pattern deleted.
${parameter%%word}
    Remove Largest Suffix Pattern. The word shall be expanded to produce a pattern. The parameter expansion shall then result in parameter, with the largest portion of the suffix matched by the pattern deleted.
${parameter#word}
    Remove Smallest Prefix Pattern. The word shall be expanded to produce a pattern. The parameter expansion shall then result in parameter, with the smallest portion of the prefix matched by the pattern deleted.
${parameter##word}
    Remove Largest Prefix Pattern. The word shall be expanded to produce a pattern. The parameter expansion shall then result in parameter, with the largest portion of the prefix matched by the pattern deleted.

The following sections are informative.
Examples

${parameter:-word}
    In this example, ls is executed only if x is null or unset. (The $( ls) command substitution notation is explained in Command Substitution.)

        ${x:-$(ls)}

${parameter:=word}

    unset X
    echo ${X:=abc}
    abc

${parameter:?word}

    unset posix
    echo ${posix:?}
    sh: posix: parameter null or not set

${parameter:+word}

    set a b c
    echo ${3:+posix}
    posix

${#parameter}

    HOME=/usr/posix
    echo ${#HOME}
    10

${parameter%word}

    x=file.c
    echo ${x%.c}.o
    file.o

${parameter%%word}

    x=posix/src/std
    echo ${x%%/*}
    posix

${parameter#word}

    x=$HOME/src/cmd
    echo ${x#$HOME}
    /src/cmd

${parameter##word}

    x=/one/two/three
    echo ${x##*/}
    three

The double-quoting of patterns is different depending on where the double-quotes are placed:

"${x#*}"
    The asterisk is a pattern character.
${x#"*"}
    The literal asterisk is quoted and not special.

End of informative text.
2.6.3 Command Substitution

Command substitution allows the output of a command to be substituted in place of the command name itself. Command substitution shall occur when the command is enclosed as follows:

    $(command)

or (backquoted version):

    `command`

The shell shall expand the command substitution by executing command in a subshell environment (see Shell Execution Environment) and replacing the command substitution (the text of command plus the enclosing "$()" or backquotes) with the standard output of the command, removing sequences of one or more <newline>s at the end of the substitution. Embedded <newline>s before the end of the output shall not be removed; however, they may be treated as field delimiters and eliminated during field splitting, depending on the value of IFS and quoting that is in effect.

Within the backquoted style of command substitution, backslash shall retain its literal meaning, except when followed by: '$', '`', or '\' (dollar sign, backquote, backslash). The search for the matching backquote shall be satisfied by the first backquote found without a preceding backslash; during this search, if a non-escaped backquote is encountered within a shell comment, a here-document, an embedded command substitution of the $( command) form, or a quoted string, undefined results occur. A single-quoted or double-quoted string that begins, but does not end, within the "`...`" sequence produces undefined results.

With the $( command) form, all characters following the open parenthesis to the matching closing parenthesis constitute the command. Any valid shell script can be used for command, except a script consisting solely of redirections which produces unspecified results.

The results of command substitution shall not be processed for further tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, or arithmetic expansion. If a command substitution occurs inside double-quotes, field splitting and pathname expansion shall not be performed on the results of the substitution.

Command substitution can be nested. To specify nesting within the backquoted version, the application shall precede the inner backquotes with backslashes, for example:

    \`command\`

If the command substitution consists of a single subshell, such as:

    $( (command) )

a conforming application shall separate the "$(" and '(' into two tokens (that is, separate them with white space). This is required to avoid any ambiguities with arithmetic expansion.
2.6.4 Arithmetic Expansion

Arithmetic expansion provides a mechanism for evaluating an arithmetic expression and substituting its value. The format for arithmetic expansion shall be as follows:

    $((expression))

The expression shall be treated as if it were in double-quotes, except that a double-quote inside the expression is not treated specially. The shell shall expand all tokens in the expression for parameter expansion, command substitution, and quote removal.

Next, the shell shall treat this as an arithmetic expression and substitute the value of the expression. The arithmetic expression shall be processed according to the rules given in Arithmetic Precision and Operations , with the following exceptions:

    Only signed long integer arithmetic is required.

    Only the decimal-constant, octal-constant, and hexadecimal-constant constants specified in the ISO C standard, Section 6.4.4.1 are required to be recognized as constants.

    The sizeof() operator and the prefix and postfix "++" and "--" operators are not required.

    Selection, iteration, and jump statements are not supported.

All changes to variables in an arithmetic expression shall be in effect after the arithmetic expansion, as in the parameter expansion "${x=value}".

If the shell variable x contains a value that forms a valid integer constant, then the arithmetic expansions "$((x))" and "$(($x))" shall return the same value.

As an extension, the shell may recognize arithmetic expressions beyond those listed. The shell may use a signed integer type with a rank larger than the rank of signed long. The shell may use a real-floating type instead of signed long as long as it does not affect the results in cases where there is no overflow. If the expression is invalid, the expansion fails and the shell shall write a message to standard error indicating the failure.
The following sections are informative.
Examples

A simple example using arithmetic expansion:

    # repeat a command 100 times
    x=100
    while [ $x -gt 0 ]
    do
        command    x=$(($x-1))
    done

End of informative text.
2.6.5 Field Splitting

After parameter expansion ( Parameter Expansion), command substitution ( Command Substitution), and arithmetic expansion ( Arithmetic Expansion), the shell shall scan the results of expansions and substitutions that did not occur in double-quotes for field splitting and multiple fields can result.

The shell shall treat each character of the IFS as a delimiter and use the delimiters to split the results of parameter expansion and command substitution into fields.

    If the value of IFS is a <space>, <tab>, and <newline>, or if it is unset, any sequence of <space>s, <tab>s, or <newline>s at the beginning or end of the input shall be ignored and any sequence of those characters within the input shall delimit a field. For example, the input:

        <newline><space><tab>foo<tab><tab>bar<space>

    yields two fields, foo and bar.

    If the value of IFS is null, no field splitting shall be performed.

    Otherwise, the following rules shall be applied in sequence. The term " IFS white space" is used to mean any sequence (zero or more instances) of white space characters that are in the IFS value (for example, if IFS contains <space>/ <comma>/ <tab>, any sequence of <space>s and <tab>s is considered IFS white space).

        IFS white space shall be ignored at the beginning and end of the input.

        Each occurrence in the input of an IFS character that is not IFS white space, along with any adjacent IFS white space, shall delimit a field, as described previously.

        Non-zero-length IFS white space shall delimit a field.

2.6.6 Pathname Expansion

After field splitting, if set -f is not in effect, each field in the resulting command line shall be expanded using the algorithm described in Pattern Matching Notation , qualified by the rules in Patterns Used for Filename Expansion.
2.6.7 Quote Removal

The quote characters: '\', '", and '' (backslash, single-quote, double-quote) that were present in the original word shall be removed unless they have themselves been quoted.
2.7 Redirection

Redirection is used to open and close files for the current shell execution environment (see Shell Execution Environment) or for any command. Redirection operators can be used with numbers representing file descriptors (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.165, File Descriptor) as described below.

The overall format used for redirection is:

    [n]redir-op word

The number n is an optional decimal number designating the file descriptor number; the application shall ensure it is delimited from any preceding text and immediately precede the redirection operator redir-op. If n is quoted, the number shall not be recognized as part of the redirection expression. For example:

    echo \2>a

writes the character 2 into file a. If any part of redir-op is quoted, no redirection expression is recognized. For example:

    echo 2\>a

writes the characters 2>a to standard output. The optional number, redirection operator, and word shall not appear in the arguments provided to the command to be executed (if any).

Open files are represented by decimal numbers starting with zero. The largest possible value is implementation-defined; however, all implementations shall support at least 0 to 9, inclusive, for use by the application. These numbers are called "file descriptors". The values 0, 1, and 2 have special meaning and conventional uses and are implied by certain redirection operations; they are referred to as standard input, standard output, and standard error, respectively. Programs usually take their input from standard input, and write output on standard output. Error messages are usually written on standard error. The redirection operators can be preceded by one or more digits (with no intervening <blank>s allowed) to designate the file descriptor number.

If the redirection operator is "<<" or "<<-", the word that follows the redirection operator shall be subjected to quote removal; it is unspecified whether any of the other expansions occur. For the other redirection operators, the word that follows the redirection operator shall be subjected to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal. Pathname expansion shall not be performed on the word by a non-interactive shell; an interactive shell may perform it, but shall do so only when the expansion would result in one word.

If more than one redirection operator is specified with a command, the order of evaluation is from beginning to end.

A failure to open or create a file shall cause a redirection to fail.
2.7.1 Redirecting Input

Input redirection shall cause the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for reading on the designated file descriptor, or standard input if the file descriptor is not specified.

The general format for redirecting input is:

    [n]<word

where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the redirection shall refer to standard input (file descriptor 0).
2.7.2 Redirecting Output

The two general formats for redirecting output are:

    [n]>word
    [n]>|word

where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the redirection shall refer to standard output (file descriptor 1).

Output redirection using the '>' format shall fail if the noclobber option is set (see the description of set -C) and the file named by the expansion of word exists and is a regular file. Otherwise, redirection using the '>' or ">|" formats shall cause the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be created and opened for output on the designated file descriptor, or standard output if none is specified. If the file does not exist, it shall be created; otherwise, it shall be truncated to be an empty file after being opened.
2.7.3 Appending Redirected Output

Appended output redirection shall cause the file whose name results from the expansion of word to be opened for output on the designated file descriptor. The file is opened as if the open() function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 was called with the O_APPEND flag. If the file does not exist, it shall be created.

The general format for appending redirected output is as follows:

    [n]>>word

where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the redirection refers to standard output (file descriptor 1).
2.7.4 Here-Document

The redirection operators "<<" and "<<-" both allow redirection of lines contained in a shell input file, known as a "here-document", to the input of a command.

The here-document shall be treated as a single word that begins after the next <newline> and continues until there is a line containing only the delimiter and a <newline>, with no <blank>s in between. Then the next here-document starts, if there is one. The format is as follows:

    [n]<<word
        here-document
    delimiter

where the optional n represents the file descriptor number. If the number is omitted, the here-document refers to standard input (file descriptor 0).

If any character in word is quoted, the delimiter shall be formed by performing quote removal on word, and the here-document lines shall not be expanded. Otherwise, the delimiter shall be the word itself.

If no characters in word are quoted, all lines of the here-document shall be expanded for parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion. In this case, the backslash in the input behaves as the backslash inside double-quotes (see Double-Quotes). However, the double-quote character ( '"' ) shall not be treated specially within a here-document, except when the double-quote appears within "$()", "``", or "${}".

If the redirection symbol is "<<-", all leading <tab>s shall be stripped from input lines and the line containing the trailing delimiter. If more than one "<<" or "<<-" operator is specified on a line, the here-document associated with the first operator shall be supplied first by the application and shall be read first by the shell.
The following sections are informative.
Examples

An example of a here-document follows:

    cat <<eof1; cat <<eof2
    Hi,
    eof1
    Helene.
    eof2

End of informative text.
2.7.5 Duplicating an Input File Descriptor

The redirection operator:

    [n]<&word

shall duplicate one input file descriptor from another, or shall close one. If word evaluates to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by n, or standard input if n is not specified, shall be made to be a copy of the file descriptor denoted by word; if the digits in word do not represent a file descriptor already open for input, a redirection error shall result; see Consequences of Shell Errors. If word evaluates to '-', file descriptor n, or standard input if n is not specified, shall be closed. Attempts to close a file descriptor that is not open shall not constitute an error. If word evaluates to something else, the behavior is unspecified.
2.7.6 Duplicating an Output File Descriptor

The redirection operator:

    [n]>&word

shall duplicate one output file descriptor from another, or shall close one. If word evaluates to one or more digits, the file descriptor denoted by n, or standard output if n is not specified, shall be made to be a copy of the file descriptor denoted by word; if the digits in word do not represent a file descriptor already open for output, a redirection error shall result; see Consequences of Shell Errors. If word evaluates to '-', file descriptor n, or standard output if n is not specified, is closed. Attempts to close a file descriptor that is not open shall not constitute an error. If word evaluates to something else, the behavior is unspecified.
2.7.7 Open File Descriptors for Reading and Writing

The redirection operator:

    [n]<>word

shall cause the file whose name is the expansion of word to be opened for both reading and writing on the file descriptor denoted by n, or standard input if n is not specified. If the file does not exist, it shall be created.
2.8 Exit Status and Errors
2.8.1 Consequences of Shell Errors

For a non-interactive shell, an error condition encountered by a special built-in (see Special Built-In Utilities) or other type of utility shall cause the shell to write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit as shown in the following table:

Error
	

Special Built-In
	

Other Utilities

Shell language syntax error
	

Shall exit
	

Shall exit

Utility syntax error (option or operand error)
	

Shall exit
	

Shall not exit

Redirection error
	

Shall exit
	

Shall not exit

Variable assignment error
	

Shall exit
	

Shall not exit

Expansion error
	

Shall exit
	

Shall exit

Command not found
	

N/A
	

May exit

Dot script not found
	

Shall exit
	

N/A

An expansion error is one that occurs when the shell expansions defined in Word Expansions are carried out (for example, "${x!y}", because '!' is not a valid operator); an implementation may treat these as syntax errors if it is able to detect them during tokenization, rather than during expansion.

If any of the errors shown as "shall exit" or "(may) exit" occur in a subshell, the subshell shall (respectively may) exit with a non-zero status, but the script containing the subshell shall not exit because of the error.

In all of the cases shown in the table, an interactive shell shall write a diagnostic message to standard error without exiting.
2.8.2 Exit Status for Commands

Each command has an exit status that can influence the behavior of other shell commands. The exit status of commands that are not utilities is documented in this section. The exit status of the standard utilities is documented in their respective sections.

If a command is not found, the exit status shall be 127. If the command name is found, but it is not an executable utility, the exit status shall be 126. Applications that invoke utilities without using the shell should use these exit status values to report similar errors.

If a command fails during word expansion or redirection, its exit status shall be greater than zero.

Internally, for purposes of deciding whether a command exits with a non-zero exit status, the shell shall recognize the entire status value retrieved for the command by the equivalent of the wait() function WEXITSTATUS macro (as defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001). When reporting the exit status with the special parameter '?', the shell shall report the full eight bits of exit status available. The exit status of a command that terminated because it received a signal shall be reported as greater than 128.
2.9 Shell Commands

This section describes the basic structure of shell commands. The following command descriptions each describe a format of the command that is only used to aid the reader in recognizing the command type, and does not formally represent the syntax. Each description discusses the semantics of the command; for a formal definition of the command language, consult Shell Grammar.

A command is one of the following:

    Simple command (see Simple Commands)

    Pipeline (see Pipelines)

    List compound-list (see Lists)

    Compound command (see Compound Commands)

    Function definition (see Function Definition Command)

Unless otherwise stated, the exit status of a command shall be that of the last simple command executed by the command. There shall be no limit on the size of any shell command other than that imposed by the underlying system (memory constraints, {ARG_MAX}, and so on).
2.9.1 Simple Commands

A "simple command" is a sequence of optional variable assignments and redirections, in any sequence, optionally followed by words and redirections, terminated by a control operator.

When a given simple command is required to be executed (that is, when any conditional construct such as an AND-OR list or a case statement has not bypassed the simple command), the following expansions, assignments, and redirections shall all be performed from the beginning of the command text to the end:

    The words that are recognized as variable assignments or redirections according to Shell Grammar Rules are saved for processing in steps 3 and 4.

    The words that are not variable assignments or redirections shall be expanded. If any fields remain following their expansion, the first field shall be considered the command name and remaining fields are the arguments for the command.

    Redirections shall be performed as described in Redirection.

    Each variable assignment shall be expanded for tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal prior to assigning the value.

In the preceding list, the order of steps 3 and 4 may be reversed for the processing of special built-in utilities; see Special Built-In Utilities.

If no command name results, variable assignments shall affect the current execution environment. Otherwise, the variable assignments shall be exported for the execution environment of the command and shall not affect the current execution environment (except for special built-ins). If any of the variable assignments attempt to assign a value to a read-only variable, a variable assignment error shall occur. See Consequences of Shell Errors for the consequences of these errors.

If there is no command name, any redirections shall be performed in a subshell environment; it is unspecified whether this subshell environment is the same one as that used for a command substitution within the command. (To affect the current execution environment, see the exec() special built-in.) If any of the redirections performed in the current shell execution environment fail, the command shall immediately fail with an exit status greater than zero, and the shell shall write an error message indicating the failure. See Consequences of Shell Errors for the consequences of these failures on interactive and non-interactive shells.

If there is a command name, execution shall continue as described in Command Search and Execution . If there is no command name, but the command contained a command substitution, the command shall complete with the exit status of the last command substitution performed. Otherwise, the command shall complete with a zero exit status.
Command Search and Execution

If a simple command results in a command name and an optional list of arguments, the following actions shall be performed:

    If the command name does not contain any slashes, the first successful step in the following sequence shall occur:

        If the command name matches the name of a special built-in utility, that special built-in utility shall be invoked.

        If the command name matches the name of a function known to this shell, the function shall be invoked as described in Function Definition Command. If the implementation has provided a standard utility in the form of a function, it shall not be recognized at this point. It shall be invoked in conjunction with the path search in step 1d.

        If the command name matches the name of a utility listed in the following table, that utility shall be invoked.


        alias
        bg
        cd
        command
         
        	


        false
        fc
        fg
        getopts
         
        	


        jobs
        kill
        newgrp
        pwd
         
        	


        read
        true
        umask
        unalias
         
        	


        wait
         

        Otherwise, the command shall be searched for using the PATH environment variable as described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 8, Environment Variables:

            If the search is successful:

                If the system has implemented the utility as a regular built-in or as a shell function, it shall be invoked at this point in the path search.

                Otherwise, the shell executes the utility in a separate utility environment (see Shell Execution Environment) with actions equivalent to calling the execve() function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 with the path argument set to the pathname resulting from the search, arg0 set to the command name, and the remaining arguments set to the operands, if any.

                If the execve() function fails due to an error equivalent to the [ENOEXEC] error defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, the shell shall execute a command equivalent to having a shell invoked with the pathname resulting from the search as its first operand, with any remaining arguments passed to the new shell, except that the value of "$0" in the new shell may be set to the command name. If the executable file is not a text file, the shell may bypass this command execution. In this case, it shall write an error message, and shall return an exit status of 126.

            Once a utility has been searched for and found (either as a result of this specific search or as part of an unspecified shell start-up activity), an implementation may remember its location and need not search for the utility again unless the PATH variable has been the subject of an assignment. If the remembered location fails for a subsequent invocation, the shell shall repeat the search to find the new location for the utility, if any.

            If the search is unsuccessful, the command shall fail with an exit status of 127 and the shell shall write an error message.

    If the command name contains at least one slash, the shell shall execute the utility in a separate utility environment with actions equivalent to calling the execve() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 with the path and arg0 arguments set to the command name, and the remaining arguments set to the operands, if any.

    If the execve() function fails due to an error equivalent to the [ENOEXEC] error, the shell shall execute a command equivalent to having a shell invoked with the command name as its first operand, with any remaining arguments passed to the new shell. If the executable file is not a text file, the shell may bypass this command execution. In this case, it shall write an error message and shall return an exit status of 126.

2.9.2 Pipelines

A pipeline is a sequence of one or more commands separated by the control operator '|'. The standard output of all but the last command shall be connected to the standard input of the next command.

The format for a pipeline is:

    [!] command1 [ | command2 ...]

The standard output of command1 shall be connected to the standard input of command2. The standard input, standard output, or both of a command shall be considered to be assigned by the pipeline before any redirection specified by redirection operators that are part of the command (see Redirection).

If the pipeline is not in the background (see Asynchronous Lists), the shell shall wait for the last command specified in the pipeline to complete, and may also wait for all commands to complete.
Exit Status

If the reserved word ! does not precede the pipeline, the exit status shall be the exit status of the last command specified in the pipeline. Otherwise, the exit status shall be the logical NOT of the exit status of the last command. That is, if the last command returns zero, the exit status shall be 1; if the last command returns greater than zero, the exit status shall be zero.
2.9.3 Lists

An AND-OR list is a sequence of one or more pipelines separated by the operators "&&" and "||" .

A list is a sequence of one or more AND-OR lists separated by the operators ';' and '&' and optionally terminated by ';', '&', or <newline>.

The operators "&&" and "||" shall have equal precedence and shall be evaluated with left associativity. For example, both of the following commands write solely bar to standard output:

    false && echo foo || echo bar
    true || echo foo && echo bar

A ';' or <newline> terminator shall cause the preceding AND-OR list to be executed sequentially; an '&' shall cause asynchronous execution of the preceding AND-OR list.

The term "compound-list" is derived from the grammar in Shell Grammar; it is equivalent to a sequence of lists, separated by <newline>s, that can be preceded or followed by an arbitrary number of <newline>s.
The following sections are informative.
Examples

The following is an example that illustrates <newline>s in compound-lists:

    while
        # a couple of <newline>s


        # a list
        date && who || ls; cat file
        # a couple of <newline>s


        # another list
        wc file > output & true


    do
        # 2 lists
        ls
        cat file
    done

End of informative text.
Asynchronous Lists

If a command is terminated by the control operator ampersand ( '&' ), the shell shall execute the command asynchronously in a subshell. This means that the shell shall not wait for the command to finish before executing the next command.

The format for running a command in the background is:

    command1 & [command2 & ... ]

The standard input for an asynchronous list, before any explicit redirections are performed, shall be considered to be assigned to a file that has the same properties as /dev/null. If it is an interactive shell, this need not happen. In all cases, explicit redirection of standard input shall override this activity.

When an element of an asynchronous list (the portion of the list ended by an ampersand, such as command1, above) is started by the shell, the process ID of the last command in the asynchronous list element shall become known in the current shell execution environment; see Shell Execution Environment. This process ID shall remain known until:

    The command terminates and the application waits for the process ID.

    Another asynchronous list invoked before "$!" (corresponding to the previous asynchronous list) is expanded in the current execution environment.

The implementation need not retain more than the {CHILD_MAX} most recent entries in its list of known process IDs in the current shell execution environment.
Exit Status

The exit status of an asynchronous list shall be zero.
Sequential Lists

Commands that are separated by a semicolon ( ';' ) shall be executed sequentially.

The format for executing commands sequentially shall be:

    command1 [; command2] ...

Each command shall be expanded and executed in the order specified.
Exit Status

The exit status of a sequential list shall be the exit status of the last command in the list.
AND Lists

The control operator "&&" denotes an AND list. The format shall be:

    command1 [ && command2] ...

First command1 shall be executed. If its exit status is zero, command2 shall be executed, and so on, until a command has a non-zero exit status or there are no more commands left to execute. The commands are expanded only if they are executed.
Exit Status

The exit status of an AND list shall be the exit status of the last command that is executed in the list.
OR Lists

The control operator "||" denotes an OR List. The format shall be:

    command1 [ || command2] ...

First, command1 shall be executed. If its exit status is non-zero, command2 shall be executed, and so on, until a command has a zero exit status or there are no more commands left to execute.
Exit Status

The exit status of an OR list shall be the exit status of the last command that is executed in the list.
2.9.4 Compound Commands

The shell has several programming constructs that are "compound commands", which provide control flow for commands. Each of these compound commands has a reserved word or control operator at the beginning, and a corresponding terminator reserved word or operator at the end. In addition, each can be followed by redirections on the same line as the terminator. Each redirection shall apply to all the commands within the compound command that do not explicitly override that redirection.
Grouping Commands

The format for grouping commands is as follows:

(compound-list)
    Execute compound-list in a subshell environment; see Shell Execution Environment. Variable assignments and built-in commands that affect the environment shall not remain in effect after the list finishes.
{ compound-list;}
    Execute compound-list in the current process environment. The semicolon shown here is an example of a control operator delimiting the } reserved word. Other delimiters are possible, as shown in Shell Grammar; a <newline> is frequently used.

Exit Status

The exit status of a grouping command shall be the exit status of compound-list.
The for Loop

The for loop shall execute a sequence of commands for each member in a list of items. The for loop requires that the reserved words do and done be used to delimit the sequence of commands.

The format for the for loop is as follows:

    for name [ in [word ... ]]do
        compound-list


    done

First, the list of words following in shall be expanded to generate a list of items. Then, the variable name shall be set to each item, in turn, and the compound-list executed each time. If no items result from the expansion, the compound-list shall not be executed. Omitting:

    in word ...

shall be equivalent to:

    in "$@"

Exit Status

The exit status of a for command shall be the exit status of the last command that executes. If there are no items, the exit status shall be zero.
Case Conditional Construct

The conditional construct case shall execute the compound-list corresponding to the first one of several patterns (see Pattern Matching Notation) that is matched by the string resulting from the tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, arithmetic expansion, and quote removal of the given word. The reserved word in shall denote the beginning of the patterns to be matched. Multiple patterns with the same compound-list shall be delimited by the '|' symbol. The control operator ')' terminates a list of patterns corresponding to a given action. The compound-list for each list of patterns, with the possible exception of the last, shall be terminated with ";;". The case construct terminates with the reserved word esac ( case reversed).

The format for the case construct is as follows:

    case word in
        [(]pattern1) compound-list;;
        [[(]pattern[ | pattern] ... ) compound-list;;] ...
        [[(]pattern[ | pattern] ... ) compound-list]


    esac

The ";;" is optional for the last compound-list.

In order from the beginning to the end of the case statement, each pattern that labels a compound-list shall be subjected to tilde expansion, parameter expansion, command substitution, and arithmetic expansion, and the result of these expansions shall be compared against the expansion of word, according to the rules described in Pattern Matching Notation (which also describes the effect of quoting parts of the pattern). After the first match, no more patterns shall be expanded, and the compound-list shall be executed. The order of expansion and comparison of multiple patterns that label a compound-list statement is unspecified.
Exit Status

The exit status of case shall be zero if no patterns are matched. Otherwise, the exit status shall be the exit status of the last command executed in the compound-list.
The if Conditional Construct

The if command shall execute a compound-list and use its exit status to determine whether to execute another compound-list.

The format for the if construct is as follows:

    if compound-listthen
        compound-list[elif compound-listthen
        compound-list] ...
    [else
        compound-list]


    fi

The if compound-list shall be executed; if its exit status is zero, the then compound-list shall be executed and the command shall complete. Otherwise, each elif compound-list shall be executed, in turn, and if its exit status is zero, the then compound-list shall be executed and the command shall complete. Otherwise, the else compound-list shall be executed.
Exit Status

The exit status of the if command shall be the exit status of the then or else compound-list that was executed, or zero, if none was executed.
The while Loop

The while loop shall continuously execute one compound-list as long as another compound-list has a zero exit status.

The format of the while loop is as follows:

    while compound-list-1do
        compound-list-2


    done

The compound-list-1 shall be executed, and if it has a non-zero exit status, the while command shall complete. Otherwise, the compound-list-2 shall be executed, and the process shall repeat.
Exit Status

The exit status of the while loop shall be the exit status of the last compound-list-2 executed, or zero if none was executed.
The until Loop

The until loop shall continuously execute one compound-list as long as another compound-list has a non-zero exit status.

The format of the until loop is as follows:

    until compound-list-1do
        compound-list-2


    done

The compound-list-1 shall be executed, and if it has a zero exit status, the until command completes. Otherwise, the compound-list-2 shall be executed, and the process repeats.
Exit Status

The exit status of the until loop shall be the exit status of the last compound-list-2 executed, or zero if none was executed.
2.9.5 Function Definition Command

A function is a user-defined name that is used as a simple command to call a compound command with new positional parameters. A function is defined with a "function definition command".

The format of a function definition command is as follows:

    fname() compound-command[io-redirect ...]

The function is named fname; the application shall ensure that it is a name (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.230, Name). An implementation may allow other characters in a function name as an extension. The implementation shall maintain separate name spaces for functions and variables.

The argument compound-command represents a compound command, as described in Compound Commands.

When the function is declared, none of the expansions in Word Expansions shall be performed on the text in compound-command or io-redirect; all expansions shall be performed as normal each time the function is called. Similarly, the optional io-redirect redirections and any variable assignments within compound-command shall be performed during the execution of the function itself, not the function definition. See Consequences of Shell Errors for the consequences of failures of these operations on interactive and non-interactive shells.

When a function is executed, it shall have the syntax-error and variable-assignment properties described for special built-in utilities in the enumerated list at the beginning of Special Built-In Utilities.

The compound-command shall be executed whenever the function name is specified as the name of a simple command (see Command Search and Execution). The operands to the command temporarily shall become the positional parameters during the execution of the compound-command; the special parameter '#' also shall be changed to reflect the number of operands. The special parameter 0 shall be unchanged. When the function completes, the values of the positional parameters and the special parameter '#' shall be restored to the values they had before the function was executed. If the special built-in return is executed in the compound-command, the function completes and execution shall resume with the next command after the function call.
Exit Status

The exit status of a function definition shall be zero if the function was declared successfully; otherwise, it shall be greater than zero. The exit status of a function invocation shall be the exit status of the last command executed by the function.
2.10 Shell Grammar

The following grammar defines the Shell Command Language. This formal syntax shall take precedence over the preceding text syntax description.
2.10.1 Shell Grammar Lexical Conventions

The input language to the shell must be first recognized at the character level. The resulting tokens shall be classified by their immediate context according to the following rules (applied in order). These rules shall be used to determine what a "token" is that is subject to parsing at the token level. The rules for token recognition in Token Recognition shall apply.

    A <newline> shall be returned as the token identifier NEWLINE.

    If the token is an operator, the token identifier for that operator shall result.

    If the string consists solely of digits and the delimiter character is one of '<' or '>', the token identifier IO_NUMBER shall be returned.

    Otherwise, the token identifier TOKEN results.

Further distinction on TOKEN is context-dependent. It may be that the same TOKEN yields WORD, a NAME, an ASSIGNMENT, or one of the reserved words below, dependent upon the context. Some of the productions in the grammar below are annotated with a rule number from the following list. When a TOKEN is seen where one of those annotated productions could be used to reduce the symbol, the applicable rule shall be applied to convert the token identifier type of the TOKEN to a token identifier acceptable at that point in the grammar. The reduction shall then proceed based upon the token identifier type yielded by the rule applied. When more than one rule applies, the highest numbered rule shall apply (which in turn may refer to another rule). (Note that except in rule 7, the presence of an '=' in the token has no effect.)

The WORD tokens shall have the word expansion rules applied to them immediately before the associated command is executed, not at the time the command is parsed.
2.10.2 Shell Grammar Rules

    [Command Name]

    When the TOKEN is exactly a reserved word, the token identifier for that reserved word shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned. Also, if the parser is in any state where only a reserved word could be the next correct token, proceed as above.

    Note:
        Because at this point quote marks are retained in the token, quoted strings cannot be recognized as reserved words. This rule also implies that reserved words are not recognized except in certain positions in the input, such as after a <newline> or semicolon; the grammar presumes that if the reserved word is intended, it is properly delimited by the user, and does not attempt to reflect that requirement directly. Also note that line joining is done before tokenization, as described in Escape Character (Backslash) , so escaped <newline>s are already removed at this point.

    Rule 1 is not directly referenced in the grammar, but is referred to by other rules, or applies globally.

    [Redirection to or from filename]

    The expansions specified in Redirection shall occur. As specified there, exactly one field can result (or the result is unspecified), and there are additional requirements on pathname expansion.

    [Redirection from here-document]

    Quote removal shall be applied to the word to determine the delimiter that is used to find the end of the here-document that begins after the next <newline>.

    [Case statement termination]

    When the TOKEN is exactly the reserved word esac, the token identifier for esac shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.

    [ NAME in for]

    When the TOKEN meets the requirements for a name (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.230, Name), the token identifier NAME shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.

    [Third word of for and case]

        [ case only]

        When the TOKEN is exactly the reserved word in, the token identifier for in shall result. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.

        [ for only]

        When the TOKEN is exactly the reserved word in or do, the token identifier for in or do shall result, respectively. Otherwise, the token WORD shall be returned.

    (For a. and b.: As indicated in the grammar, a linebreak precedes the tokens in and do. If <newline>s are present at the indicated location, it is the token after them that is treated in this fashion.)

    [Assignment preceding command name]

        [When the first word]

        If the TOKEN does not contain the character '=', rule 1 is applied. Otherwise, 7b shall be applied.

        [Not the first word]

        If the TOKEN contains the equal sign character:

            If it begins with '=', the token WORD shall be returned.

            If all the characters preceding '=' form a valid name (see the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 3.230, Name), the token ASSIGNMENT_WORD shall be returned. (Quoted characters cannot participate in forming a valid name.)

            Otherwise, it is unspecified whether it is ASSIGNMENT_WORD or WORD that is returned.

    Assignment to the NAME shall occur as specified in Simple Commands.

    [ NAME in function]

    When the TOKEN is exactly a reserved word, the token identifier for that reserved word shall result. Otherwise, when the TOKEN meets the requirements for a name, the token identifier NAME shall result. Otherwise, rule 7 applies.

    [Body of function]

    Word expansion and assignment shall never occur, even when required by the rules above, when this rule is being parsed. Each TOKEN that might either be expanded or have assignment applied to it shall instead be returned as a single WORD consisting only of characters that are exactly the token described in Token Recognition.

2.11 Signals and Error Handling

When a command is in an asynchronous list, the shell shall prevent SIGQUIT and SIGINT signals from the keyboard from interrupting the command. Otherwise, signals shall have the values inherited by the shell from its parent (see also the trap special built-in).

When a signal for which a trap has been set is received while the shell is waiting for the completion of a utility executing a foreground command, the trap associated with that signal shall not be executed until after the foreground command has completed. When the shell is waiting, by means of the wait utility, for asynchronous commands to complete, the reception of a signal for which a trap has been set shall cause the wait utility to return immediately with an exit status >128, immediately after which the trap associated with that signal shall be taken.

If multiple signals are pending for the shell for which there are associated trap actions, the order of execution of trap actions is unspecified.
2.12 Shell Execution Environment

A shell execution environment consists of the following:

    Open files inherited upon invocation of the shell, plus open files controlled by exec

    Working directory as set by cd

    File creation mask set by umask

    Current traps set by trap

    Shell parameters that are set by variable assignment (see the set special built-in) or from the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 environment inherited by the shell when it begins (see the export special built-in)

    Shell functions; see Function Definition Command

    Options turned on at invocation or by set

    Process IDs of the last commands in asynchronous lists known to this shell environment; see Asynchronous Lists

    Shell aliases; see Alias Substitution

Utilities other than the special built-ins (see Special Built-In Utilities) shall be invoked in a separate environment that consists of the following. The initial value of these objects shall be the same as that for the parent shell, except as noted below.

    Open files inherited on invocation of the shell, open files controlled by the exec special built-in plus any modifications, and additions specified by any redirections to the utility

    Current working directory

    File creation mask

    If the utility is a shell script, traps caught by the shell shall be set to the default values and traps ignored by the shell shall be set to be ignored by the utility; if the utility is not a shell script, the trap actions (default or ignore) shall be mapped into the appropriate signal handling actions for the utility

    Variables with the export attribute, along with those explicitly exported for the duration of the command, shall be passed to the utility environment variables

The environment of the shell process shall not be changed by the utility unless explicitly specified by the utility description (for example, cd and umask).

A subshell environment shall be created as a duplicate of the shell environment, except that signal traps set by that shell environment shall be set to the default values. Changes made to the subshell environment shall not affect the shell environment. Command substitution, commands that are grouped with parentheses, and asynchronous lists shall be executed in a subshell environment. Additionally, each command of a multi-command pipeline is in a subshell environment; as an extension, however, any or all commands in a pipeline may be executed in the current environment. All other commands shall be executed in the current shell environment.
2.13 Pattern Matching Notation

The pattern matching notation described in this section is used to specify patterns for matching strings in the shell. Historically, pattern matching notation is related to, but slightly different from, the regular expression notation described in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Chapter 9, Regular Expressions. For this reason, the description of the rules for this pattern matching notation are based on the description of regular expression notation, modified to include backslash escape processing.
2.13.1 Patterns Matching a Single Character

The following patterns matching a single character shall match a single character: ordinary characters, special pattern characters, and pattern bracket expressions. The pattern bracket expression also shall match a single collating element. A backslash character shall escape the following character. The escaping backslash shall be discarded.

An ordinary character is a pattern that shall match itself. It can be any character in the supported character set except for NUL, those special shell characters in Quoting that require quoting, and the following three special pattern characters. Matching shall be based on the bit pattern used for encoding the character, not on the graphic representation of the character. If any character (ordinary, shell special, or pattern special) is quoted, that pattern shall match the character itself. The shell special characters always require quoting.

When unquoted and outside a bracket expression, the following three characters shall have special meaning in the specification of patterns:

?
    A question-mark is a pattern that shall match any character.
*
    An asterisk is a pattern that shall match multiple characters, as described in Patterns Matching Multiple Characters.
[
    The open bracket shall introduce a pattern bracket expression.

The description of basic regular expression bracket expressions in the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 9.3.5, RE Bracket Expression shall also apply to the pattern bracket expression, except that the exclamation mark character ( '!' ) shall replace the circumflex character ( '^' ) in its role in a "non-matching list" in the regular expression notation. A bracket expression starting with an unquoted circumflex character produces unspecified results.

When pattern matching is used where shell quote removal is not performed (such as in the argument to the find - name primary when find is being called using one of the exec functions as defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, or in the pattern argument to the fnmatch() function), special characters can be escaped to remove their special meaning by preceding them with a backslash character. This escaping backslash is discarded. The sequence "\\" represents one literal backslash. All of the requirements and effects of quoting on ordinary, shell special, and special pattern characters shall apply to escaping in this context.
2.13.2 Patterns Matching Multiple Characters

The following rules are used to construct patterns matching multiple characters from patterns matching a single character:

    The asterisk ( '*' ) is a pattern that shall match any string, including the null string.

    The concatenation of patterns matching a single character is a valid pattern that shall match the concatenation of the single characters or collating elements matched by each of the concatenated patterns.

    The concatenation of one or more patterns matching a single character with one or more asterisks is a valid pattern. In such patterns, each asterisk shall match a string of zero or more characters, matching the greatest possible number of characters that still allows the remainder of the pattern to match the string.

2.13.3 Patterns Used for Filename Expansion

The rules described so far in Patterns Matching a Single Character and Patterns Matching Multiple Characters are qualified by the following rules that apply when pattern matching notation is used for filename expansion:

    The slash character in a pathname shall be explicitly matched by using one or more slashes in the pattern; it shall neither be matched by the asterisk or question-mark special characters nor by a bracket expression. Slashes in the pattern shall be identified before bracket expressions; thus, a slash cannot be included in a pattern bracket expression used for filename expansion. If a slash character is found following an unescaped open square bracket character before a corresponding closing square bracket is found, the open bracket shall be treated as an ordinary character. For example, the pattern "a[b/c]d" does not match such pathnames as abd or a/d. It only matches a pathname of literally a[b/c]d.

    If a filename begins with a period ( '.' ), the period shall be explicitly matched by using a period as the first character of the pattern or immediately following a slash character. The leading period shall not be matched by:

        The asterisk or question-mark special characters

        A bracket expression containing a non-matching list, such as "[!a]", a range expression, such as "[%-0]", or a character class expression, such as "[[:punct:]]"

    It is unspecified whether an explicit period in a bracket expression matching list, such as "[.abc]", can match a leading period in a filename.

    Specified patterns shall be matched against existing filenames and pathnames, as appropriate. Each component that contains a pattern character shall require read permission in the directory containing that component. Any component, except the last, that does not contain a pattern character shall require search permission. For example, given the pattern:

        /foo/bar/x*/bam

    search permission is needed for directories / and foo, search and read permissions are needed for directory bar, and search permission is needed for each x* directory. If the pattern matches any existing filenames or pathnames, the pattern shall be replaced with those filenames and pathnames, sorted according to the collating sequence in effect in the current locale. If the pattern contains an invalid bracket expression or does not match any existing filenames or pathnames, the pattern string shall be left unchanged.

2.14 Special Built-In Utilities

The following "special built-in" utilities shall be supported in the shell command language. The output of each command, if any, shall be written to standard output, subject to the normal redirection and piping possible with all commands.

The term "built-in" implies that the shell can execute the utility directly and does not need to search for it. An implementation may choose to make any utility a built-in; however, the special built-in utilities described here differ from regular built-in utilities in two respects:

    A syntax error in a special built-in utility may cause a shell executing that utility to abort, while a syntax error in a regular built-in utility shall not cause a shell executing that utility to abort. (See Consequences of Shell Errors for the consequences of errors on interactive and non-interactive shells.) If a special built-in utility encountering a syntax error does not abort the shell, its exit value shall be non-zero.

    Variable assignments specified with special built-in utilities remain in effect after the built-in completes; this shall not be the case with a regular built-in or other utility.

The special built-in utilities in this section need not be provided in a manner accessible via the exec family of functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001.

Some of the special built-ins are described as conforming to the Base Definitions volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines. For those that are not, the requirement in Utility Description Defaults that "--" be recognized as a first argument to be discarded does not apply and a conforming application shall not use that argument.
